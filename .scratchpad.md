# Test Scratchpad in Open Agent Platform

## Testing Notes

- **Project**: open-agent-platform (selected)
- **Workspace Root**: /mnt/c/00_ConceptV/06_Project_Vi/repos/open-agent-platform
- **Purpose**: Test scratchpad functionality in selected workspace

## Current Status

✓ Project selection reports success
✓ File system tools work in project directory
✗ `get_current_project` still fails
✗ `notes_scratchpad` still fails

## Key Finding

Even with a successfully selected project, the scratchpad tools still report "NO_WORKSPACE_SELECTED". This confirms there's a **systemic issue** with the workspace context mechanism.

## Files in Project

The open-agent-platform contains:
- Multiple markdown documentation files
- apps/ directory (likely contains agent applications)
- Standard Node.js project structure
- Various configuration files

## Conclusion

The scratchpad tools appear to have a **fundamental disconnect** from the project selection system, making them non-functional in their current state.
